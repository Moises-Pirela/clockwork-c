/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Queries
 *
 * A filter selects visible entities (active and not marked for destruction)
 * whose signature contains every component in `all`, at least one component
 * in `any` (ignored when `any` is empty) and no component in `none`.
 * Components named by a filter need not be registered yet; an unregistered
 * component is simply never present.
 *
 * Ad-hoc queries (cw_query_iter / cw_query_iter_filter) read the component
 * pools directly and carry no state beyond the iterator value.
 *
 * Cached queries (cw_query_create) keep a bitset of the matching entities and
 * an O(1) count that the world maintains eagerly on every entity lifecycle
 * change (create, restore, rebuild, mark-destroy, sweep, reset) and every
 * component membership change (add/set/unmarshal of a new component, remove).
 * Only queries whose filter mentions the changed component are touched. The
 * cache grows automatically with the world and is unaffected by late component
 * registration or pool growth.
 *
 * Access declarations: every cached query declares which components the
 * code driving it reads and writes (cw_access). Declarations are not
 * enforced at access time; they are metadata for scheduling and conflict
 * detection: two queries conflict on a component when one writes it and the
 * other reads or writes it, unless their filters are provably disjoint
 * (cw_filter_disjoint). Writes may name any component, including ones the
 * filter excludes (adding a component is a write); reads may not name a
 * component in `none`, since it is never present. cw_query_create declares
 * the conservative default of reading every component in `all` and `any`
 * and writing nothing; use cw_query_create_access to declare precisely.
 *
 * Ownership and lifetime:
 *   - Cached queries are allocated and owned by the world. cw_query_create
 *     returns a stable handle; creating an identical filter and access twice
 *     returns the same handle with its reference count bumped, and handles
 *     with the same filter but different access share one underlying entity
 *     cache. Every successful create must be paired with cw_query_destroy,
 *     which releases the handle (and the cache, once unused) when the last
 *     reference is gone. cw_world_destroy releases every remaining query and
 *     invalidates all handles. cw_world_reset keeps queries alive (they
 *     simply become empty), since they describe schema, not entities.
 *   - A cw_query iterator is a plain value that borrows the world (and the
 *     cached query, if any). It needs no cleanup and may be copied freely. It
 *     must not outlive its world or cached query.
 *
 * Mutation during iteration is safe for everything except destroying the
 * world or the cached query being iterated: entities may be created, marked,
 * swept, restored, rebuilt, and components may be added or removed. An entity
 * that stops matching before it is reached is never yielded. An entity that
 * starts matching is yielded by a cached iteration if its id is above the
 * cursor (the live bitset is read on every step); an ad-hoc iteration
 * snapshots 64 entities at a time and may miss one that starts matching inside
 * the current block. Ids are yielded in ascending order. Creating or
 * destroying other queries from inside an iteration is allowed.
 *
 * Allocation-free use: a cw_query iterator is a stack value and no query
 * function allocates after the cached query has been created, so walking,
 * counting, testing membership and fetching components are safe in hot
 * loops. Prefer the early-exit helpers over collecting: cw_query_is_empty
 * and cw_query_count are O(1) on cached queries; cw_query_first,
 * cw_query_single and cw_query_count_filter stop as soon as the answer is
 * known; cw_query_matches tests one entity against any iterator.
 *
 * Component access: cw_comp_ptr/cw_comp_get/CW_GET work on any id a query
 * yields. cw_query_get/cw_query_write (CW_QUERY_GET/CW_QUERY_WRITE) are the
 * checked forms: they return NULL unless the entity is in the query, carries
 * the component, and the component is covered by the query's declared access
 * (reads or writes for get, writes for write), and cw_query_write records a
 * modification for observers. Pool storage is virtually reserved for CW_POOL_RESERVE_ENTITIES
 * entities, so component pointers stay valid across entity creation and world
 * growth up to that size; beyond it, growth may relocate a pool and every
 * pointer into it must be re-fetched. Pointers never survive cw_comp_remove,
 * sweep of that entity, or cw_world_destroy. Queries are single-threaded.

 * Change tracking
 *
 * An observer watches one component and accumulates three sets of entities:

 *   CW_CHANGE_MODIFIED  the component's value was written (additions count
 *                       as writes; so do cw_comp_set, cw_comp_unmarshal,
 *                       cw_comp_write/CW_WRITE and cw_comp_touch; plain
 *                       cw_comp_get/CW_GET pointer writes are invisible)
 *   CW_CHANGE_REMOVED   the component was removed, including by sweep,
 *                       rebuild and reset
 *
 * Each observer is one consumer's private cursor: cw_observer_observe moves
 * everything accumulated since the previous call into the observed sets and
 * starts accumulating afresh, without affecting any other observer. The
 * observed sets stay stable until the next observe, so a consumer can walk
 * them at leisure (but must not observe while walking).
 *
 * Events are recorded as they happen, so within one window an entity may be
 * both added and removed (for instance when its id was recycled) or modified
 * and then removed. cw_observer_count/has/bits/gather report the raw sets;
 * cw_observer_iter additionally skips added/modified entities that no longer
 * carry the component or are invisible (pending destruction), so every id it
 * yields can be read with CW_GET. Removed entities may be dead already.
 *
 * For conflict detection an observer is a reader of its component
 * (cw_observer_access): it conflicts with any query that writes the
 * component, regardless of filters, because additions and removals anywhere
 * are events too. Observers never conflict with each other.
 *
 * Observers are owned by the world: create them once per consumer, destroy
 * them when done, or let cw_world_destroy release the remainder. They
 * survive cw_world_reset (the reset itself shows up as removals), grow with
 * the world, and may watch components that are registered later.

 * after the flush the real ids are available from cw_commands_created, in

 * empty buffer is a no-op).
 *
 * cw_commands_update applies a callback to a component at flush time, which
 * is the tool for accumulating changes such as damage from several sources:
 * every recorded update runs, in order, against the then-current value.
 * cw_commands_call defers arbitrary work. Callbacks run during the flush and
 * must not record into the buffer being flushed (recording returns false).
 *

 * allocation-free once cw_commands_reserve has sized the stream; otherwise
 * it grows geometrically. Payloads are copied at record time and aligned to
 * 16 bytes when handed back to callbacks.
 *

 * visible to the next phase. cw_world_reset and cw_world_destroy discard it.

 *     Writes never fail (allocation failure aborts, as everywhere else).
 *   - fixed (cw_writer_init_fixed with storage): writes that do not fit set
 *     the sticky `overflow` flag and return false, but `size` keeps counting
 *     the bytes the content needs, so a too-small buffer still reports the
 *     required size. Nothing is written past the capacity.
 *   - measuring (cw_writer_init_fixed with NULL): stores nothing, only
 *     counts; writes return true.
 * This mirrors the codec marshal contract, so a codec can implement marshal
 * as cw_writer_init_fixed(&wr, data, capacity) ... *size = wr.size;
 * return !wr.overflow.
 *
 * A cw_reader borrows a byte range; reads past the end fail, set the sticky
 * `error` flag, store 0 in the output and leave the position unchanged, so a
 * sequence of reads can be checked once with cw_reader_ok. cw_reader_sub
 * carves a length-delimited span into its own bounded reader.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Snapshots
 *
 * cw_snapshot_save serialises a world's entities into a versioned binary
 * image appended to a cw_writer; cw_snapshot_load rebuilds that image in a
 * fresh world whose component schema the caller has registered beforehand.
 *
 * What is captured: every active entity (including those marked for
 * destruction, which are re-marked on load), the components it carries, the
 * tick, the id allocator (next_id, recycle_ids, the recycled id list in
 * order) and last_created. Entity ids are preserved exactly, and after a
 * load the world hands out the same ids the saved world would have. Not
 * captured: the registry itself, cached queries, observers, command buffers,
 * the created list and the user pointer; loaded entities are reported in
 * cw_world_created like any restored entity so EntityCreated systems can
 * rebuild transient state.
 *
 * Schema: components are matched by registered name, never by id, so the
 * loading world may register them in any order. Each present component is
 * encoded by its marshal callback, or, when it has none and the save
 * config allows it, as the raw bytes of its slot (host layout; the loader
 * requires an identical element size and host byte order). Transient
 * components are skipped unless include_transient is set. Only components
 * some entity actually carries appear in the image.
 *
 * Ownership and failure: the caller owns the writer, the input bytes, the
 * world and the configs; nothing is retained. A failed save truncates the
 * writer back to its initial size; with a fixed writer that is too small the
 * error reports the bytes required. A load validates the whole image against
 * the limits and the registered schema before touching the world, so most
 * failures leave it untouched; if a codec then rejects a payload the world
 * is reset, so it is fresh again either way. The world must be fresh to
 * begin with: no entities, next_id zero, no recycled ids (a new or reset
 * world).
 *
 * Limits: every count and length in the image is checked against the load
 * config before any memory is committed, which makes untrusted input safe
 * to pass; zero fields take the defaults below, SIZE_MAX / INT64_MAX mean
 * unlimited. Trailing bytes after the image are an error; cw_snapshot_peek
 * reports the image size for callers embedding snapshots in larger streams.
 *
 * Format (CW_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT_VERSION, all integers little-endian):
 *   header   magic "CWSN", u16 version, u16 flags (bit 0: raw payloads
 *            were written on a big-endian host), u64 total size including
 *            the header, u32 user version, u32 section count
 *   section  u32 tag, u64 payload length, payload; unknown tags are skipped
 *     "WRLD" u64 tick, i64 next_id, i64 last_created, u8 recycle_ids
 *     "SCHM" u16 count, then per component: u8 saved id, u8 encoding
 *            (1 codec, 2 raw), u64 element size, u16 name length, name
 *     "ENTS" u64 count, then per entity in ascending id order: i64 id,
 *            u8 flags (bit 2: marked for destruction), u8 component count,
 *            then per component: u8 saved id, u32 length, payload
 *     "RCYL" u64 count, i64 ids in list order

 * with allow_raw, else CW_SNAPSHOT_ERROR_NO_CODEC.
